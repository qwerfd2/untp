# fixed-untp
Fixed untp for python3.10+. Usage is the same as original repo, only this time without the installation bloat, and corrected a bunch of python2 era problems.

As of now only support encrypted pvr.ccz, as this is the only work case I use. If you have unencrypted pvr.ccz the original repo's release works.
